# Search Engine Reliability Analyzer

##WEBSITE:
  https://search-engine-reliablity-daa.streamlit.app/

This project evaluates the reliability and performance of different search engines (Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo) based on search results and sorting algorithm performance. The app fetches real-world search results using the SerpAPI, compares them, and measures the performance of different sorting algorithms.

## Features:
- **Search Engine Reliability**: Compares results from Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo using Jaccard Similarity.
- **Sorting Algorithm Performance**: Tests the time taken by different sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort) on the search engine results.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit to allow users to input queries and visualize the results.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The backend language for handling logic and API requests.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web application.
- **SerpAPI**: To fetch real-time search engine results (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo).
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort.
